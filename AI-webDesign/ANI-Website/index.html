          Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence
          in computers that have been trained to think and behave like humans.
          The word may also refer to any computer that exhibits human-like
          characteristics like learning and problem-solving.

          Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), or narrow intelligence, is the
          courteous name for the weak AI. Narrow artificial intelligence is a
          type of artificial intelligence in which a learning algorithm is
          created to perform a single function. Any knowledge acquired through
          this activity will not be applied to other activities.

          class="section-img"
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Artificial narrow intelligence is designed to complete a single
          activity without human help successfully. Language translation and
          image recognition are two examples of common uses for narrow AI.

      <h1 id="topic-3" class="heading-1">
        Artificial Narrow Intelligence Explained:
      </h1>
      <div class="section-3 section-container">
        <p class="paragraph">
          Artificial narrow intelligence systems can perform in real-time but
          retrieve data from a particular database. As a result, these
          technologies aren’t capable of handling other tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Artificial narrow intelligence is not conscious, aware, or motivated
          by emotion in the same way that humans are. Even if Narrow AI appears
          to be considerably more sophisticated, it operates within a
          pre-determined, pre-defined scope.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Today’s machine intelligence is all Narrow AI. Google Assistant,
          Google Translate, Siri, and other natural language processing tools
          are examples of Narrow AI. Although these tools appear to be able to
          interact with us and process human language, they lack the capability
          for autonomous reasoning, self-awareness, consciousness, and genuine
          intelligence. In other words, they are unable to think.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The question is: What are the characteristics of an intelligent
          machine? In other words, what distinguishes a conscious computer from
          one that merely responds to queries? The difference is that a
          conscious computer can think independently, make judgments, and make
          decisions. We already have this ability as human beings. When we talk
          to Siri, it isn’t performing a conscious function of answering our
          questions. Rather, what Siri is capable of — what it was designed to
          do — is human process language and submit it to a search engine for
          retrieval.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          This explains why, when we ask Siri or Google Assistant abstract
          questions like “What is the meaning of life?” or “How do I deal with a
          personal problem,” we frequently get evasive answers that make no
          sense or links to pre-existing articles from the Internet that address
          these topics. However, when we ask Siri what the weather is outside,
          we get a proper answer. These digital assistants were designed to
          handle basic inquiries.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          People can perceive their surroundings, be conscious, and experience
          emotionally charged reactions to events. In many cases, AI agents lack
          the flexibility and adaptability to think as we do. Except that a
          self-driving car comprises numerous artificial narrow intelligence
          systems, even something as complicated as a self-driving automobile is
          labeled Weak AI.
